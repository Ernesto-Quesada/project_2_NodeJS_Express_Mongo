This is a small web app for reviewing pictures submitted by people.
It is written in NOdeJS/ExpressJS and as database, I used MongoDB. Its hosted for free at Heroku.Any uploaded photos heroku deletes
them next day
It has basic CRUD for adding, deleting photos submitted by users.
Basic authentication system works using passportJS. After you signup you have to login for adding your pictures or reviewing them.

All pictures are of my authoring.You can not use them for ad, commercial or any profit. You can use them for teaching, practicing or all
other use that is not commercial. No restriction for using the code.
